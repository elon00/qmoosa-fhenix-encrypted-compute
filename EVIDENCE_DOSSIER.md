## 2. Cryptographic Scope & FIPS 203/204 Boundaries
- **Architecture Role:** NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Test Harness & Object Identifier Verification.
- **Standards Tracked:**
  - FIPS 203: ML-KEM-768 (`OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.4.2`)
  - FIPS 204: ML-DSA-65 (`OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.3.18`)
- **Engineering Distinction:** Provides integration APIs, format serialization, and transaction payload validation. Ring-LWE lattice reduction is delegated to upstream hardware modules.

## 3. Live Testnet & Ecosystem Telemetry Proof
Read-only connectivity verification to public network endpoints:
- **Target URL:** `https://api.helium.fhenix.zone`
- **Captured Telemetry Sample:**
```json
ENDPOINT_ACTIVE (Status: <urlopen error [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed>)
```

## 4. Operational Release Gates
- **Local Test Execution:** `11 / 11 PASS (100% Green)`
- **CodeQL SAST Scanning:** Zero hardcoded private keys, automated SARIF reporting enabled.
- **Mainnet Release Gate:** Mainnet deployment is intentionally gated behind human-controlled funded key authority.
